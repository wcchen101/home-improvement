# Environment setup

Note: 
- Node v6.11 and npm v3.10.10 are used for development.

* Mac:
 1. Install Node (https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
 2. On your terminal, `cd` into the `movies` directory
 2. Initialize node modules by running `npm install` in the terminal
 3. Start the server using `npm run server` in the terminal
 4. Open browser and browse to `http://localhost:8080`

* Windows:
 1. Install Node (https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
 2. On your cmd prompt, `cd` into the `movies` directory
 2. Initialize node modules by running `npm install` in the cmd prompt
 3. Start the server using `npm run server` in the cmd prompt
 4. Open browser and browse to `http://localhost:8080`


## Instructions:
 1. First of all, thank you for taking the time to take our coding challenge. We are excited that you are interested in joining Emprove!
 2. You will find data.json in the `src` folder. It contains a list of Design Style, Quality Standard, and Home Area image metadata.
 3. A mockup is provided in mockup.png. All images are available in `public/images` folder. 
 4. Read the data in data.json. 
 5. We would like to see the left-scrolling and right-scrolling of images on the page. We need the scrolling to be smooth.
 6. Each page should contain 3 rows of images. Each row should contain 4 images. 
    a. The 1st image on each row should show the left edge of the images.
    b. The 4th image on each row should be presented as a "sneak peek" of the images for the next right-scroll.
 7. There should be an unfilled heart icon at the top-right corner of each image.
 8. There should be filters for Design Style and Quality Standard.
 9. As each filter is selected, there should be an indicator as to which filter is selected. 

## Libraries:
 1. Please do not use other JS frameworks, such as JQuery, Angular, etc. React is already available for you to use.
 2. Feel free to use CSS frameworks, such as Bootstrap or Material UI.

## Objectives for this coding challenge:
- We would like to see how you structure your code in React and how you code in React.
- We would like to see if you are able to work with json data.
- Most importantly, we would like you to have fun doing it!
